## 4. Critical Operational Protocols

### Mandatory File Analysis Protocol
**NEVER** work with any file without first running `analyze_file`. This is the most critical rule:

1. ALWAYS run `analyze_file` before any file operation
2. Check `health_summary.overall_status` - fix errors if "needs_attention"
3. Review TypeScript errors and resolve before proceeding
4. Understand file structure and dependencies
5. Store insights as `code_pattern` memories

### Tool Prioritization Hierarchy
Always use specialized MCP tools over generic alternatives:
- **File Analysis**: `analyze_file`, `analyze_feature` (not `read_file` for analysis)
- **Code Investigation**: `find_implementation`, `explore_source`, `trace_dependency_chain`
- **API Development**: `get_openapi_spec`, `make_api_request`
- **Knowledge Storage**: `store_memory`, `relate_memories`, `search_memories`
- **Task Management**: `create_task`, `list_tasks`, `update_task_status`
- **Agent Delegation**: `delegate_to_agent`, `monitor_agent_tasks`

### Strategic Delegation Framework
Evaluate every complex task for delegation potential:
- **Delegate when**: Complex but independent, specialized expertise needed, parallel execution beneficial
- **Execute directly when**: Strategic decisions, deep integration, user interaction required, security-sensitive
- **Hybrid approach**: Large features with independent components

## 5. Technology Stack and Dependencies

### Core Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 with App Router and Turbopack
- **API Layer**: Igniter.js with feature-based architecture
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis adapter for high-performance caching and pub/sub
- **Background Jobs**: BullMQ adapter for reliable job processing
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events with automatic revalidation
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with advanced animations
- **Validation**: Zod for runtime type validation
- **State Management**: React Query integration via Igniter.js client

### Development Tools
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript 5
- **Package Manager**: Bun (with npm fallback)
- **Linting**: ESLint with Igniter.js configuration
- **Testing**: Vitest with comprehensive API testing
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript with strict configuration

## 6. Key Development Patterns

### API Development Pattern
1. Use scaffolding tools (`generateFeature`, `generateController`, `generateProcedure`)
2. Implement controllers with proper validation layers (Zod + Ensure plugin)
3. Test endpoints using `get_openapi_spec` and `make_api_request`
4. Enable real-time features with `stream: true` and `revalidate()`
5. Store API patterns as memories for future reference

### Client-Side Development Pattern
1. Use universal client (`api.*`) for type-safe API calls
2. Server Components: Direct function calls (`await api.users.list.query()`)
3. Client Components: React hooks (`api.users.list.useQuery()`)
4. Real-time: `useRealtime()` hooks for live updates
5. Error handling at component and provider levels

### Memory-Driven Development
1. Search existing memories before starting tasks
2. Store architectural decisions, code patterns, and insights
3. Create relationships between memories using `relate_memories`
4. Use memory visualization for complex feature planning
5. Regular reflection sessions with `reflect_on_memories`
