INTEGRATIONS PAGE TEST - FINDINGS SUMMARY
===============================================

TEST OBJECTIVE:
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/integracoes and verify card creation functionality.
Determine if new cards appear after form submission.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Server: Running on localhost:3000 (verified)
- Database: PostgreSQL on localhost:5432 (NOT RUNNING)
- Framework: Next.js 15 + Igniter.js
- UI: shadcn/ui + Radix UI

AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM:
- Type: Magic Link + OTP (not traditional password)
- Flow: Email -> OTP Code -> Access Token
- Limitation: Requires email verification

SCREENSHOTS CAPTURED:
1. 01-login-page.png - Initial login page with email input
2. 02-after-login.png - Validation error when submitting empty email
3. 03-integracoes-initial.png - Redirects to login (authentication required)

CODE ANALYSIS - FRONTEND:

File: src/app/integracoes/page.tsx
- Loads instances on mount via GET /api/v1/instances
- On card creation:
  1. Calls handleCreateIntegration()
  2. POST to /api/v1/instances with form data
  3. On success: setInstances(prev => [newInstance, ...prev])
  4. Shows success toast
  5. Updates UI with new card at top of list

File: src/components/integrations/CreateIntegrationModal.tsx
- 5-step wizard modal
- Calls parent onCreate callback on submit
- Expected behavior: Card appears immediately in list

EXPECTED CARD APPEARANCE FLOW:
User submits form
  -> API POST /api/v1/instances (201 Created)
  -> Frontend receives response
  -> Frontend adds to state: setInstances(prev => [newInstance, ...prev])
  -> UI re-renders
  -> Card appears at top of list

CODE ANALYSIS - BACKEND:

File: src/features/instances/controllers/instances.controller.ts

Create endpoint POST /api/v1/instances:
1. Validates authentication (required)
2. Validates phone number format (if provided)
3. Checks organization instance limit
4. Verifies instance name uniqueness
5. Creates instance in UAZapi (external service)
6. Saves to PostgreSQL database
7. Returns HTTP 201 with instance data

LIST endpoint GET /api/v1/instances:
- Returns paginated list of user's instances
- Filters by organization ID
- Supports search and status filters

ISSUES BLOCKING COMPLETE TESTING:

Issue 1: DATABASE NOT RUNNING
- PostgreSQL required on localhost:5432
- All database operations return: "Can't reach database server"
- Need to: docker-compose up -d

Issue 2: AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED
- All API endpoints require valid auth token
- OTP system requires email verification
- Cannot test without proper login

Issue 3: REAL-TIME UPDATES (SSE)
- Console shows: "SSE connection error provider=IgniterProvider"
- Expected when not authenticated
- Will work with valid auth

CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT:

Positive Findings:
✓ Proper state management (React hooks)
✓ Optimistic UI updates implemented
✓ Error handling with user feedback
✓ Comprehensive validation in backend
✓ Organization-level access control (RBAC)
✓ Toast notifications for user actions
✓ Modal wizard for user guidance

Potential Issues:
- Requires database for all operations
- No offline/fallback mode
- OTP system complicates testing

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR (ONCE DATABASE RUNNING):

When user creates "Test Instance":
1. Modal opens (5-step wizard)
2. User fills name field: "Test Instance"
3. User clicks "Criar" (Create) button
4. Modal shows loading state
5. API request: POST /api/v1/instances
6. Response: 201 Created with instance data
7. Card SHOULD appear at top of list
8. Card shows: Name, Status (connecting), Creation date
9. Success toast: "Integração criada com sucesso!"
10. Modal moves to "Compartilhar" (Share) step

SUCCESS INDICATORS:
✓ Card appears immediately
✓ Card shows correct name
✓ Card shows status
✓ Card shows creation date
✓ No errors in console
✓ Success toast appears
✓ Modal transitions to next step

FAILURE INDICATORS:
✗ Card does not appear
✗ Card appears with wrong data
✗ Network error in console
✗ API returns error
✗ Modal stays on same step
✗ No success toast

NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE TESTING:

1. Start database:
   docker-compose up -d

2. Run migrations:
   npm run prisma:migrate

3. Seed test user (optional):
   npm run prisma:seed
   Creates: admin@quayer.com

4. Run improved test script:
   npx tsx test-with-api-login.ts

5. Verify in screenshots:
   - test-screenshots/10-integracoes-initial.png
   - test-screenshots/11-modal-opened.png
   - test-screenshots/12-form-filled.png
   - test-screenshots/13-after-submission.png

FILES CREATED:
- test-integrations-complete.ts
- test-with-api-login.ts
- INTEGRACOES_TEST_REPORT.md
- test-screenshots/ (directory with images)

CONCLUSION:

Code review indicates the feature is CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED:
- Frontend properly updates UI on success
- Backend properly validates and creates instance
- No obvious bugs in logic flow

Testing is BLOCKED by:
1. Database not running
2. Authentication system requires OTP/email verification

Once database is running, the feature should work as expected.
