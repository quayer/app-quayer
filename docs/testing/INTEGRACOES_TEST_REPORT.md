# Test Report: Integrations Page Card Creation Bug Investigation

## Executive Summary

This report documents a comprehensive investigation into the integrations page at `http://localhost:3000/integracoes` to test the card creation functionality and identify bugs related to card appearance after form submission.

**Status**: Investigation limited by database connectivity issues, but code analysis completed.

**Key Finding**: Application uses magic link/OTP authentication system (not traditional passwords).

---

## Test Environment

- Server: Running on http://localhost:3000
- Framework: Next.js 15 with Igniter.js
- Database: PostgreSQL (NOT RUNNING on localhost:5432)
- Authentication: Magic Link + OTP System
- UI Framework: shadcn/ui + Radix UI

## Screenshots Captured

### 01-login-page.png - Initial Login
Shows Quayer login page with email-based authentication system

### 02-after-login.png - Login Validation
Shows validation error on login attempt (field required)

### 03-integracoes-initial.png - Integrations Access
Shows redirect to login when accessing /integracoes without authentication

## Key Code Implementation

### Frontend: Page Creation Flow

Location: src/app/integracoes/page.tsx

The main page implements the following logic:

1. Load instances on mount via GET /api/v1/instances
2. When user creates instance:
   - Calls handleCreateIntegration function
   - Makes POST /api/v1/instances request
   - On success, adds instance to state with: setInstances(prev => [newInstance, ...prev])
   - Shows success toast notification
   - Modal closes

### Frontend: Modal Component

Location: src/components/integrations/CreateIntegrationModal.tsx

5-step wizard with:
1. Channel selection
2. Configuration (name, description, webhook)
3. Connection (QR code)
4. Sharing options
5. Success screen

### Backend: Instance Creation

Location: src/features/instances/controllers/instances.controller.ts

POST /api/v1/instances handler:
1. Validates authentication
2. Checks phone number format
3. Verifies organization instance limits
4. Checks instance name uniqueness
5. Creates instance in UAZapi (external service)
6. Saves to PostgreSQL database
7. Returns response.created(instance)

---

## Authentication System

The application uses email-based OTP (One-Time Password) authentication:

1. User enters email
2. System sends OTP code to email inbox
3. User enters OTP on verification page
4. User receives access token
5. User redirected to target page

This is different from traditional email+password auth.

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: Database Not Running
- PostgreSQL not accessible on localhost:5432
- All API calls that touch database return 500 error
- Error: "Can't reach database server at localhost:5432"

### Issue 2: Authentication Required
- All features require authenticated user session
- API endpoints protected with authProcedure middleware
- OTP system requires email access for testing

### Issue 3: Real-Time Updates
- Application shows SSE connection errors when not authenticated
- Expected when user is not authenticated

## Expected Card Creation Behavior

When user creates instance named "Test Instance":

1. Form submitted to POST /api/v1/instances
2. Backend creates instance and returns it
3. Frontend receives response
4. Frontend adds newInstance to state: setInstances(prev => [newInstance, ...prev])
5. UI re-renders showing new card at top
6. Card displays instance name, status, creation date
7. Success toast shows: "Integração criada com sucesso!"

The code shows this is implemented correctly in handleCreateIntegration function.

---

## Required to Complete Testing

1. Start PostgreSQL database: docker-compose up -d
2. Run migrations: npm run prisma:migrate
3. Seed test user if needed: npm run prisma:seed
4. Run test scripts with database connection

---

## Test Artifacts

- test-integrations-complete.ts - Multi-step Playwright test
- test-with-api-login.ts - Direct API authentication test
- test-screenshots/ - Captured screenshots

---

## Conclusion

Code analysis shows the card creation feature is properly implemented. The optimistic UI update in handleCreateIntegration should display the card immediately upon successful API response.

No bugs detected in code logic. Testing blocked by:
1. Database not running
2. Authentication system requires OTP/email
