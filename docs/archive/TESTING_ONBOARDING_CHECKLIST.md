-- Should show businessHoursStart, businessHoursEnd, businessDays, timezone

-- User updated with:
SELECT onboardingCompleted, currentOrgId FROM "User"
WHERE email = 'test-onboarding@example.com';
-- onboardingCompleted = true, currentOrgId should be set

-- UserOrganization relation created:

-- User should be linked with master role
```

### **Test 2: Organization Switcher (GOD/Admin Users)**

#### Objective
Verify that admin users can switch between organizations using the organization switcher in the user menu.

#### Prerequisites
- Create a GOD/admin user (first user in system, or user with role='admin')
- Create at least 2 organizations in the database

#### Steps
1. **Login as Admin User**
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Verify you land on `/admin` dashboard

2. **Open Organization Switcher**
   - Click on the user avatar/name in the sidebar (bottom-left)
   - Verify dropdown menu opens
   - Verify "Contexto Administrativo" section is visible (GOD only)
   - Verify current organization name is displayed

3. **Test Organization Search**
   - Click on the organization switcher item
   - Modal should open with "Trocar Organiza√ß√£o" title
   - Type organization name in search field
   - Verify filtered results appear

4. **Switch Organization**
   - Select a different organization from the list
   - Click on the organization button
   - Verify:
     - ‚úÖ Toast success message appears
     - ‚úÖ Page refreshes
     - ‚úÖ New organization context is active
     - ‚úÖ Access token is updated in localStorage

5. **Verify Current Organization Badge**
   - Reopen organization switcher

   - Verify it's highlighted with secondary variant

#### Expected Behavior
- Non-admin users should NOT see "Contexto Administrativo" section
- Admin users can switch to ANY organization (even if not a member)
- Current organization is persisted in `User.currentOrgId`
- New JWT token includes updated `currentOrgId` and `organizationRole`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Organization not found" on `/organizacao`
**Solution:** Ensure the user has `currentOrgId` set in their User record.

### Issue: Onboarding page not redirecting after completion
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify `accessToken` is being saved to localStorage.

### Issue: Organization switcher shows no organizations
**Solution:** Verify the `organizations.list.query()` endpoint is working. Check if user is actually admin (`role = 'admin'`).

### Issue: Migration errors
**Solution:** Use `npx prisma db push` instead of `migrate dev` if starting fresh.

FROM "User"
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Check organization with business hours
SELECT id, name, slug, businessHoursStart, businessHoursEnd, businessDays, timezone
FROM "Organization"
ORDER BY createdAt DESC;

-- Check user-organization relationships
SELECT u.email, o.name as organization, uo.role
FROM "UserOrganization" uo
JOIN "User" u ON u.id = uo.userId
JOIN "Organization" o ON o.id = uo.organizationId
WHERE uo.isActive = true;

-- Check for GOD/admin users
SELECT id, email, name, role, currentOrgId
FROM "User"
WHERE role = 'admin';
```
